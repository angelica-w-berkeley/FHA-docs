/*
- Given a table of authors, a table of work's authors, and a table of work's citations,
  create a longform table where each row is an author, academic age, # works published at that age, total # of lifetime citations works published that yr received
  - only includes lifetime cites of works published before 2013 (otherwise there wouldn't be 10 yrs of citation counts)
  - lifetime citations only includes citations received up to 10 yrs after a paper's publication
