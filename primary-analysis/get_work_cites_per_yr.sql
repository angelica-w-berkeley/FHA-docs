/*
Given a table of works and a table of works' citations, 
create a longform table where each row is a work, year, and how many times that work was cited that year

Parameters:
Works table:
    Column Name         | Data Type | Description
    --------------------|-----------|------------------------
    id                  | STRING    | Unique OpenAlex ID for work
    publication_year    | INT       | yr this work was published
    concept_0           | STRING    | top level 0 concept assigned to work

Works' citations table:
    Column Name         | Data Type | Description
    --------------------|-----------|------------------------
    id                  | STRING    | OpenAlex ID for work
    publication_year    | INT       | yr this work was published
    cited_works_id      | STRING    | OpenAlex ID of work that this work cites (this work â‡’ cited_work)

Returns:
Table with how many times a given work was cited in a given year:
    Column Name     | Data Type | Description
