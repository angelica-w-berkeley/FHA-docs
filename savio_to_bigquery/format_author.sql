/*
- Given a single table of authors where each row is a JSON object, extract the desired fields,
  convert the table into standard csv format, and add carnegie classification for authorsâ€™ affiliated institution
- Includes calculations for the top 3 level 0 concepts
- Last used on May 3, 2023 snapshot of OpenAlex, so includes more recently added fields (impact factor, h-index, i-10 index)

Parameters:
Unformatted authors table with single column of JSON object files:
    Column Name  | Data Type | Description
    -------------|-----------|------------------------
    author       | STRING    | author entity as JSON object

    Column Name         | Data Type | Description
    --------------------|-----------|------------------------
    affiliation_name    | STRING    | institution name
    institution_type    | STRING    | institution type matching with 90% fuzziness (0:teaching, 1:research)
