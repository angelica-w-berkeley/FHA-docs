# Descriptives

To get a better sense of the data we are working with, we generated multiple figures describing the data, all of which can be found in the [figures] folder. The code for the figures is in the [descriptives] Jupyter Notebook, using the tables generated by the SQL files here.

[figures]: ../descriptives/figures/
[descriptives]: ../descriptives/descriptives.ipynb
